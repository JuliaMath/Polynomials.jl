The [Chebyshev polynomials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev_polynomials) are two sequences of polynomials, `T_n` and `U_n`. The Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind, `T_n`, can be defined by the recurrence relation `T_0(x)=1`, `T_1(x)=x`, and `T_{n+1}(x) = 2xT_n{x}-T_{n-1}(x)`. The Chebyshev polynomioals of the second kind, `U_n(x)`, can be defined by `U_0(x)=1`, `U_1(x)=2x`, and `U_{n+1}(x) = 2xU_n(x) - U_{n-1}(x)`. Both `T_n` and `U_n` have degree `n`, and any polynomial  of  degree `n` may be uniquely written as a linear combination of the polynomials `T_0`, `T_1`, ..., `T_n` (similarly with `U`).


## First Kind

```@docs
ChebyshevT
```

The `ChebyshevT` type holds coefficients representing the polynomial `a_0 T_0 + a_1 T_1 + ... + a_n T_n`.

For example, the basis polynomial `T_4` can be represented with `ChebyshevT([0,0,0,0,1])`.


### Conversion

[`ChebyshevT`](@ref) can be converted to [`Polynomial`](@ref) and vice-versa.

```jldoctest
julia> c = ChebyshevT([1, 0, 3, 4])
ChebyshevT(1⋅T_0(x) + 3⋅T_2(x) + 4⋅T_3(x))


julia> p = convert(Polynomial, c)
Polynomial(-2 - 12*x + 6*x^2 + 16*x^3)

julia> convert(ChebyshevT, p)
ChebyshevT(1.0⋅T_0(x) + 3.0⋅T_2(x) + 4.0⋅T_3(x))
```
