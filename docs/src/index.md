# Polynomials.jl

Polynomials.jl is a Julia package that provides basic arithmetic, integration,
differentiation, evaluation, and root finding over dense univariate polynomials.

To install the package, run

```julia
(v1.2) pkg> add Polynomials
```

The package can then be loaded into the current session using

```julia
using Polynomials
```

```@meta
DocTestSetup = quote
  using Polynomials
end
```

## Quick Start

### Construction and Evaluation

Construct a polynomial from its coefficients, lowest order first.

```jldoctest
julia> Polynomial([1,0,3,4])
Polynomial(1 + 3*x^2 + 4*x^3)
```

An optional variable parameter can be added.

```jldoctest
julia> Polynomial([1,2,3], :s)
Polynomial(1 + 2*s + 3*s^2)
```

Construct a polynomial from its roots.

```jldoctest
julia> fromroots([1,2,3]) # (x-1)*(x-2)*(x-3)
Polynomial(-6 + 11*x - 6*x^2 + x^3)
```

Evaluate the polynomial `p` at `x`.

```jldoctest
julia> p = Polynomial([1, 0, -1])
Polynomial(1 - x^2)

julia> p(1)
0

```

### Arithmetic

The usual arithmetic operators are overloaded to work on polynomials, and combinations of polynomials and scalars.

```jldoctest
julia> p = Polynomial([1,2])
Polynomial(1 + 2*x)

julia> q = Polynomial([1, 0, -1])
Polynomial(1 - x^2)

julia> 2p
Polynomial(2 + 4*x)

julia> 2 + p
Polynomial(3 + 2*x)

julia> p - q
Polynomial(2*x + x^2)

julia> p * q
Polynomial(1 + 2*x - x^2 - 2*x^3)

julia> q / 2
Polynomial(0.5 - 0.5*x^2)

julia> q ÷ p  # `div`, also `rem` and `divrem`
Polynomial(0.25 - 0.5*x)
```

Note that operations involving polynomials with different variables will error.

```jldoctest
julia> p = Polynomial([1, 2, 3], :x)
Polynomial(1 + 2*x + 3*x^2)

julia> q = Polynomial([1, 2, 3], :s)
Polynomial(1 + 2*s + 3*s^2)

julia> p + q
ERROR: Polynomials must have same variable
[...]
```

### Integrals and Derivatives

Integrate the polynomial `p` term by term, optionally adding constant
term `C`. The degree of the resulting polynomial is one higher than the
degree of `p`.

```jldoctest
julia> integrate(Polynomial([1, 0, -1]))
Polynomial(1.0*x - 0.3333333333333333*x^3)

julia> integrate(Polynomial([1, 0, -1]), 2)
Polynomial(2.0 + 1.0*x - 0.3333333333333333*x^3)
```

Differentiate the polynomial `p` term by term. The degree of the
resulting polynomial is one lower than the degree of `p`.

```jldoctest
julia> derivative(Polynomial([1, 3, -1]))
Polynomial(3.0 - 2.0*x)
```

### Root-finding

Return the roots (zeros) of `p`, with multiplicity. The number of
roots returned is equal to the order of `p`. By design, this is not type-stable,
the returned roots may be real or complex.

```jldoctest
julia> roots(Polynomial([1, 0, -1]))
2-element Array{Float64,1}:
 -1.0
  1.0

julia> roots(Polynomial([1, 0, 1]))
2-element Array{Complex{Float64},1}:
 0.0 - 1.0im
 0.0 + 1.0im

julia> roots(Polynomial([0, 0, 1]))
2-element Array{Float64,1}:
 0.0
 0.0
```

### Fitting arbitrary data

Fit a polynomial (of degree `deg`) to `x` and `y` using polynomial interpolation or a (weighted) least-squares approximation.

```@example
using Plots, Polynomials
xs = range(0, 10, length=10)
ys = exp.(-xs)
f = fit(xs, ys)  # fit(xs, ys, k)  for fitting a kth degreee polynomial

scatter(xs, ys, label="Data");
plot!(f, extrema(xs)..., label="Fit");
savefig("polyfit.svg"); nothing # hide
```

### Other bases

A polynomial, e.g. `a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + ... + a_n x^n`, can be seen as a collection of coefficients, `[a_0, a_1, ..., a_n]`, relative to some polynomial basis. The most  familiar basis being  the standard one: `1`, `x`, `x^2`, ...  Alternative bases are possible.  The `ChebyshevT` polynomials are  implemented, as an example. Instead of `Polynomial`  or  `Polynomial{T}`, `ChebyshevT` or  `ChebyshevT{T}` constructors are used:

```jldoctest
julia> p1 = ChebyshevT([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
ChebyshevT(1.0⋅T_0(x) + 2.0⋅T_1(x) + 3.0⋅T_2(x))

julia> p2 = ChebyshevT{Float64}([0, 1, 2])
ChebyshevT(1.0⋅T_1(x) + 2.0⋅T_2(x))

julia> p1 + p2
ChebyshevT(1.0⋅T_0(x) + 3.0⋅T_1(x) + 5.0⋅T_2(x))

julia> p1 * p2
ChebyshevT(4.0⋅T_0(x) + 4.5⋅T_1(x) + 3.0⋅T_2(x) + 3.5⋅T_3(x) + 3.0⋅T_4(x))

julia> derivative(p1)
ChebyshevT(2.0⋅T_0(x) + 12.0⋅T_1(x))

julia> integrate(p2)
ChebyshevT(0.25⋅T_0(x) - 1.0⋅T_1(x) + 0.25⋅T_2(x) + 0.3333333333333333⋅T_3(x))

julia> convert(Polynomial, p1)
Polynomial(-2.0 + 2.0*x + 6.0*x^2)

julia> convert(ChebyshevT, Polynomial([1.0, 2,  3]))
ChebyshevT(2.5⋅T_0(x) + 2.0⋅T_1(x) + 1.5⋅T_2(x))
```

!!! Note
    The older  `Poly` type that this package used prior to `v0.7`  is implemented as an alternate basis  to provide support for older code bases. As of `v1.0`,  this type will be only available by executing `using Polynomials.PolyCompat`.

### Iteration

If its basis is implicit, then a polynomial may be  seen as just a vector of  coefficients. Vectors or 1-based, but, for convenience, polynomial types are 0-based, for purposes of indexing (e.g. `getindex`, `setindex!`, `eachindex`). Iteration over a polynomial steps through the basis vectors, e.g. `a_0`, `a_1*x`, ...

```jldoctest
julia> as = [1,2,3,4,5]; p = Polynomial(as);

julia> as[3], p[2], collect(p)[3]
(3, 3, Polynomial(3*x^2))
```
