## Installation

```julia
(v1.5) pkg> add Polynomials
```

## Available Types of Polynomials

* `Polynomial` –⁠ standard basis polynomials, `a(x) = a₀ + a₁ x + a₂ x² + … + aₙ xⁿ`,  `n ∈ ℕ`
* `ImmutablePolynomial` –⁠ standard basis polynomials backed by a [Tuple type](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/functions/#Tuples-1) for faster evaluation of values
* `SparsePolynomial` –⁠ standard basis polynomial backed by a [dictionary](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/collections/#Dictionaries-1) to hold  sparse high-degree  polynomials
* `LaurentPolynomial` –⁠ [Laurent polynomials](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/collections/#Dictionaries-1), `a(x) = aₘ xᵐ + … + aₙ xⁿ` `m ≤ n`, `m,n ∈ ℤ` backed by an [offset array](https://github.com/JuliaArrays/OffsetArrays.jl); for example, if `m<0` and `n>0`, `a(x) = aₘ xᵐ + … + a₋₁ x⁻¹ + a₀ + a₁ x + … +  aₙ xⁿ`
* `ChebyshevT` –⁠ [Chebyshev polynomials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev_polynomials) of the first kind

## Usage

```julia
julia> using Polynomials
```

### Construction and Evaluation

Construct a polynomial from an array (a vector) of its coefficients, lowest order first.

```julia
julia> Polynomial([1,0,3,4])
Polynomial(1 + 3*x^2 + 4*x^3)
```

Optionally, the variable of the polynomial can be specified.

```julia
julia> Polynomial([1,2,3], :s)
Polynomial(1 + 2*s + 3*s^2)
```

Construct a polynomial from its roots.

```julia
julia> fromroots([1,2,3]) # (x-1)*(x-2)*(x-3)
Polynomial(-6 + 11*x - 6*x^2 + x^3)
```

Evaluate the polynomial `p` at `x`.

```julia
julia> p = Polynomial([1, 0, -1]);
julia> p(0.1)
0.99
```

### Arithmetic

Methods are added to the usual arithmetic operators so that they work on polynomials, and combinations of polynomials and scalars.

```julia
julia> p = Polynomial([1,2])
Polynomial(1 + 2*x)

julia> q = Polynomial([1, 0, -1])
Polynomial(1 - x^2)

julia> p - q
Polynomial(2*x + x^2)

julia> p = Polynomial([1,2])
Polynomial(1 + 2*x)

julia> q = Polynomial([1, 0, -1])
Polynomial(1 - x^2)

julia> 2p
Polynomial(2 + 4*x)

julia> 2+p
Polynomial(3 + 2*x)

julia> p - q
Polynomial(2*x + x^2)

julia> p * q
Polynomial(1 + 2*x - x^2 - 2*x^3)

julia> q / 2
Polynomial(0.5 - 0.5*x^2)

julia> q ÷ p # `div`, also `rem` and `divrem`
Polynomial(0.25 - 0.5*x)
```

Operations involving polynomials with different variables will error.

```julia
julia> p = Polynomial([1, 2, 3], :x);
julia> q = Polynomial([1, 2, 3], :s);
julia> p + q
ERROR: Polynomials must have same variable.
```

### Integrals and Derivatives

Integrate the polynomial `p` term by term, optionally adding a constant
term `k`. The degree of the resulting polynomial is one higher than the
degree of `p` (for a nonzero polynomial).

```julia
julia> integrate(Polynomial([1, 0, -1]))
Polynomial(1.0*x - 0.3333333333333333*x^3)

julia> integrate(Polynomial([1, 0, -1]), 2)
Polynomial(2.0 + 1.0*x - 0.3333333333333333*x^3)
```

Differentiate the polynomial `p` term by term. The degree of the
resulting polynomial is one lower than the degree of `p`.

```julia
julia> derivative(Polynomial([1, 3, -1]))
Polynomial(3 - 2*x)
```

### Root-finding


Return the roots (zeros) of `p`, with multiplicity. The number of
roots returned is equal to the degree of `p`. By design, this is not type-stable, the returned roots may be real or complex.

```julia
julia> roots(Polynomial([1, 0, -1]))
2-element Array{Float64,1}:
 -1.0
  1.0

julia> roots(Polynomial([1, 0, 1]))
2-element Array{Complex{Float64},1}:
 0.0 - 1.0im
 0.0 + 1.0im

julia> roots(Polynomial([0, 0, 1]))
2-element Array{Float64,1}:
 0.0
 0.0
```

### Fitting arbitrary data

Fit a polynomial (of degree `deg` or less) to `x` and `y` using a least-squares approximation.

```julia
julia> xs = 0:4; ys = @. exp(-xs) + sin(xs);

julia> fit(xs, ys) |> p -> round.(coeffs(p), digits=4) |> Polynomial
Polynomial(1.0 + 0.0593*x + 0.3959*x^2 - 0.2846*x^3 + 0.0387*x^4)

julia> fit(ChebyshevT, xs, ys, 2) |> p -> round.(coeffs(p), digits=4) |> ChebyshevT
ChebyshevT(0.5413⋅T_0(x) - 0.8991⋅T_1(x) - 0.4238⋅T_2(x))
```

### Other methods

Polynomial objects also have other methods:

* 0-based indexing is used to extract the coefficients of `[a0, a1, a2, ...]`, coefficients may be changed using indexing
  notation.

* `coeffs`: returns the entire coefficient vector

* `degree`: returns the polynomial degree, `length` is number of stored coefficients

* `variable`: returns the polynomial symbol as polynomial in the underlying type

* `norm`: find the `p`-norm of a polynomial

* `conj`: finds the conjugate of a polynomial over a complex field

* `truncate`: set to 0 all small terms in a polynomial;

* `chop` chops off any small leading values that may arise due to floating point operations.

* `gcd`: greatest common divisor of two polynomials.

* `Pade`: Return the
  [Pade approximant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pad%C3%A9_approximant) of order `m/n` for a polynomial as a `Pade` object.
